**Authors:** Fatemehsadat Ghanadi Ladani, Samaneh Hosseini Semnani

**Abstract:** Pneumonia remains a significant cause of child mortality, particularly in developing countries where resources and expertise are limited. The automated detection of Pneumonia can greatly assist in addressing this challenge. In this research, an XOR based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed
to select deep features from the second last layer of a RegNet model, aiming to improve the accuracy of the CNN model on Pneumonia detection. The proposed XOR PSO algorithm offers simplicity by incorporating just one hyperparameter for initialization, and each iteration requires minimal computation time. Moreover, it achieves a balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to convergence on a suitable solution. By extracting 163 features, an impressive accuracy level of 98% was attained which demonstrates comparable accuracy to previous PSO-based methods.
